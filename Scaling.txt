Based on my analysis of the admin dashboard pages and their backend APIs, here's a comprehensive list of each page's API calls and identified issues requiring fixes or improvements for scalability:

Admin Dashboard Pages & API Analysis
1. AdminStats (Dashboard Overview)
API Calls: admin/stats-overview/ (GET)
Backend Function: stats_overview
Current Implementation: Uses optimized queries with Count() and annotate() to avoid N+1 problems
Issues/Improvements Needed:
✅ Good: Already optimized with annotations
⚠️ Add Caching: Implement Redis/memcached caching for stats that don't change frequently
✅ No Pagination Needed: Returns summary statistics
2. EnrollUser (Manual User Enrollment)
API Calls: admin/enroll-user/ (POST)
Backend Function: enroll_user
Current Implementation: Single user creation with email validation
Issues/Improvements Needed:
✅ Good: Single operation, no scalability issues
⚠️ Add Rate Limiting: Prevent abuse with too many enrollment requests
3. BulkUpload (Bulk Faculty Upload)
API Calls: admin/bulk-upload-faculty/ (POST)
Backend Function: bulk_upload_faculty
Current Implementation: Processes CSV/Excel files using pandas
Issues/Improvements Needed:
❌ Memory Intensive: Uses pandas to load entire file into memory
❌ No Streaming: Processes all rows at once
❌ No File Size Limits: Can crash with large files
⚠️ Fix Required: Implement streaming CSV processing, add file size limits (max 10MB), add progress tracking for large files
4. BranchesManagement
API Calls:
admin/branches/ (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
admin/branches-with-hods/ (GET)
admin/users/ (GET)
Backend Functions: manage_branches, get_branches_with_hods, user_directory
Current Implementation: Uses AdminPagination for branches and users
Issues/Improvements Needed:
✅ Good: Pagination implemented
⚠️ get_branches_with_hods: No pagination - could be slow with many branches
⚠️ Add Caching: Cache branch lists that don't change often
5. BatchManagement
API Calls: admin/batches/ (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
Backend Function: manage_batches
Current Implementation: Uses AdminPagination with Count() annotation
Issues/Improvements Needed:
✅ Good: Already optimized with pagination and annotations
6. NotificationsManagement
API Calls: admin/notifications/ (GET/POST)
Backend Function: manage_notifications
Current Implementation: Uses AdminPagination
Issues/Improvements Needed:
✅ Good: Pagination implemented
⚠️ Bulk Operations: POST creates notifications for all users - could be slow with many users
⚠️ Add Async Processing: Use Celery for bulk notification creation
7. HODLeavesManagement
API Calls: admin/hod-leaves/ (GET/PUT)
Backend Function: manage_hod_leaves
Current Implementation: Fetches all leaves for a month without pagination
Issues/Improvements Needed:
❌ No Pagination: GET returns all leave requests for the month
⚠️ Fix Required: Add AdminPagination to prevent loading too many records
⚠️ Add Filtering: Allow filtering by status, date range
8. UsersManagement
API Calls:
admin/users/ (GET/PUT)
admin/users/bulk-actions/ (POST)
Backend Functions: user_directory, bulk_user_actions
Current Implementation: Uses AdminPagination with select_related/prefetch_related
Issues/Improvements Needed:
✅ Good: Pagination and optimized queries
⚠️ bulk_user_actions: May need pagination for large bulk operations
9. AdminProfile
API Calls: admin/profile/<user_id>/ (GET/PATCH)
Backend Function: manageAdminProfile
Current Implementation: Single user profile operations
Issues/Improvements Needed:
✅ Good: Single operations, no issues
10. CampusLocationManager
API Calls: admin/campus-locations/ (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
Backend Function: manage_campus_location
Current Implementation: Uses AdminPagination
Issues/Improvements Needed:
✅ Good: Pagination implemented
11. TeacherBranchAssignment
API Calls:
admin/teacher-assignments/ (GET)
admin/assign-teacher-branch/ (POST)
admin/assign-teacher-subject/ (POST)
admin/remove-teacher-assignment/<id>/ (DELETE)
admin/assignment-options/ (GET)
Backend Functions: get_teacher_branch_assignments, assign_teacher_to_branch, assign_teacher_to_subject, remove_teacher_assignment, get_assignment_options
Current Implementation: get_teacher_branch_assignments fetches all teachers and assignments without pagination
Issues/Improvements Needed:
❌ No Pagination: get_teacher_branch_assignments loads all data
⚠️ Fix Required: Add AdminPagination and implement search/filtering
⚠️ Optimize Queries: Use select_related/prefetch_related more efficiently
Database Indexing Status
✅ Good: Multiple performance indexes exist (from migrations 0008-0014), including:

Attendance records indexes
Internal marks indexes
Student leave request indexes
Faculty performance indexes
Summary of Critical Fixes Needed:
BulkUpload: Implement streaming CSV processing, add file size limits
HODLeavesManagement: Add pagination to GET endpoint
TeacherBranchAssignment: Add pagination and optimize queries
NotificationsManagement: Consider async processing for bulk notifications
Add Caching: Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
Rate Limiting: Add to sensitive operations like user enrollment
